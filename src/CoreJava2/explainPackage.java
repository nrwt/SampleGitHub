package CoreJava2;

public class explainPackage {

	
	
	//package is mainly set of classes and interfaces.. for example,,,this calss is in package CoreJava2
	
	//for example ...java comes with package java.lang ,,,abd because of this pacakge we can use public static void main,,,int,, string etc
	// without defining the package name at the top we cannot access the classes or variables present in that package..
	//noe question is what we do not define java.lang package at top
	//its beacuse Java,lang== it is default package and it is inbuild within Jva compiler
	//we have other package as well java.util.. in order to use array..we import package java.util package
	//so all classes are come from java packages
	//in the same way we can create user defined packages like coreJava2 above is user defined package where we write all our classes
	//if someone want to use our classes they can just import our package.
