The Java collection framework is a collection of interfaces and classes which helps in storing and processing the data efficiently.
This Framework has tons of useful classes and all those classes have tons of functions which makes a programmable task super easy.

Below are different types of collections

1) List - A list is an ordered collection (sometimes called a sequence). It can contain duplicate elements. 
below are the classes implement List interface

ArrayList
LinkedList
Vector

2) Set - A set is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.However there is no guarantee of iteration order.
Below are classes implement Set Interface

HashSet
LinkedHashSet
TreeSet

3)Map - A map is an Object that maps the keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate values. Below are implementation of Map interface

HashMap
TreeMap
LinkedHashMap


Difference between hashmap and hashtable..

in usage and methods they are same... the only difference is -- Hahsmap is non synchronised and non thread safe while 
HashTable is synchronised and thread safe.

if your application do not require any multithreading task, then use Hahmap. Hah map can be used by multiple programs at one time..

while Hashtable. only one program or one thread can access hashmap at one time. once that thread is released only then other program can use it.
hashmap allow one null key and any number of null values, while hashtable do not allow null keys or null values

hashmap use iterator while hashtable use enumerator
